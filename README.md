📝Project description:
Web application to search and display the weather of any city using the OpenWeatherMap API.

🔧Stacks:
HTML5
CSS3
JavaScript
React-Vite

👩‍💻Work Approach:

To carry out the exercise, once the necessary installations have been completed, I have created different components to be able to execute them later in the app.In addition to the Header and Footer components, I have created the following:• WeatherSearch.jsx: to search for the city• WeatherDisplay.jsx: to display weather information in either Celsius or Fahrenheit• FavoriteCities.jsx: manages the list of favorite cities and allows you to add them to a list• TemperatureUnitSelector.jsx: will allow you to select between Celsius and Fahrenheit.Once the components were developed, we proceeded to manage all the components within the app, developing App.jsx. After this, a basic style has been given to the application to be able to make queries.
